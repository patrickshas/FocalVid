1. Download all the files to your computer.
2. Make sure all the files are located in the same folder.
3. Simply run/open "CountDown.html" using Firefox.
4. In firefox permissions (usually left side of the address line) make sure that you allow media files to run (this is needed since the files are being executed locally).
5. Refresh the page after updating permissions if needed.
